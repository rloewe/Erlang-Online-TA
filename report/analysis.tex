\section*{Analysis}
To create a distributed server structure that can handle load, which most
likely changes over time, our idea is that a master-slave architecture makes
most sense. Here the master server should handle everything related to receiving
and distributing assignments and the slave should correct them. To make the
infrastructure more dynamic, slaves servers should be able to connect and
disconnect at will, so that increasing or decreasing workload can be easily
handled.

\subsection*{Master server}
%TODO: indledning.
It has to
make sure that we create a somewhat equal load on all our nodes and that we
monitor our nodes, so we do not send handins to non-responding servers.
Handins might also need to be handled with a fairness system in mind, such that
students can not create a DOS attack by uploading their handins several times in
a row.
The master should also be able to handle different types of assignments, which
means that there should be a way that these can be described and some way of
authorizing the users who should be able to upload such.
The assignments will then have to be distributed to all nodes, also new nodes
which join at a later stage.
There should also be someway of interfacing with the master server, so that it
can be 

\subsection*{Node server}
The node server has a main goal, which is to correct assignments, but it also
needs to handle receiving the assignments and queuing them. It also needs to
make sure that the assignments are run in a secure manner, such that a student
will no be able to read other students assignments and/or mess with the system.
This can be fixed in multiple ways and might be different for each assignment,
therefore the system should be able to handle this.
Error handling is also something the nodes should do, for example an assignment
should be able to run again, if a server error happens, but should be stopped if
it fails multiple times. This could for example be fixed by monitoring processes
and restarting them, if they fail.

\subsection*{Sandboxing}
As the system should be able to handle several sandboxes, it should be easy to
extend it with another one. It should also be possible to restrict access to
specific ressources in the sandbox, eg. disabling disk or network access.
It should also be possible to limit them in other ways, for example by setting
a max runtime or max memory usage.
