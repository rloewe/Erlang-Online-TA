\chapter{Project scope}
In the course of this project we aim to create a prototype of a the
infrastructure to show that performance and do not expect to do everything that
we have put in the analysis.

We expect that we are able to add and remove servers dynamically and that we
are able to distribute our assignments well over the available servers. We also
expect that we are able to add user-defined modules and assignments.
The security system is able to handle users that are have different access
levels to the system. The users should be able to login via a web interface in
which we do not expect that we make available with SSL, as that can be done at a
later stage.
