\chapter{Security}
As the analysis discussed we have added some security thoughout the system, but also lack some in certain other areas.

There is no authentication to the server, so the system cannot authorize what which user has access to, so the user can access all information available thought the api calls currently. Since the node server runs the module code given when adding a module to the server, the system is dependant that the module creator is trusted. The submissions ability to preform harm or extract information from the system, is dependant on the implementation of the correction module. If the module allows for the submission files to be run outside the sandbox or the user breaks out of the sandbox it self, the system wont prevent it.
