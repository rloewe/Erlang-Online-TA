\chapter{Conclusion}
We created a system that was able to correct assignments over multiple servers
and with what we think is reasonable performance. We did most of what we set out
to do in our project scope, but did not get to make a user system with different
user levels, good error handling and a usable webinterface.

During the course of this project, we have learned much about erlang. We have
learned that the language is very good at what it does, which is distributed
computing, but we have also learned the dark side of languages with dynamic
types. Normally we do not see dynamic types as the worst thing, but when they
have to be distributed across multiple server it can get really hard to debug
some times, which we have felt during many countless hours of debugging.
Also we encountered that erlang is not the most consistent language out there
in terms of when we get \texttt{\{ok, Value\}} and just \texttt{Value}.

But all in all it has been a rewarding experience to make a larger project in a
language, that we normally do not use.
