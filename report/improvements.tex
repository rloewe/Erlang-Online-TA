\section{Improvements}
The code we have made, in this project, is not complete nor perfect. Therefore
we have this part of our report to discuss new features or improvements to the
project.

\subsection{Remove/update assignments and modules}
Currently it is not possible to update or remove assignments and modules. This
should be a feature in the future.

\subsection{Better error handling}

\subsection{DoS protection/fairness algorithm}
As written in the analysis, DoS protection through a scheduling algorithm with
fairness would have been a great thing to implement in this project.

\subsection{Better interface}
Currently the web-interface for the project is very sparse and not very good.
It basically just shows that we are able to do some communication with the
master server. This should definitely be improved such that different people get
access to different parts of the system, e.g. lecturers should be able to upload
assignments and students should be able to submit assignments.

Another thing would be to design an interface that is nice to look at. But as we
are Computer Science students, we normally think command line interfaces are
good enough and therefore we should probably not be the ones to design it.

\subsection{Date range for assignments}
A nice feature to add would be to add a date range for the assignments, such
that they only are active during that period. Of course it should also be
possible to circumvent that date range for certain people, so they can test it
before it launches.

\subsection{Possibility to get correction output from file}
Currently it is only possible to get correction output from \texttt{stdout}. It
would be nice if it was also possible to get that output from a file. This
should be implemented as an extra field in the assignment configuration and then
the correction scripts that are being run should then write that file.

\begin{itemize}
    \item error handling, especially in regards to build in gen\_assignment and
    add module (maybe use compile:file)
    \item Run scripts out of sandbox
    \item monitor correct\_fsms
    \item security, auth (restrict assignments to specific users)
    \item supervision trees
\end{itemize}
